  journal = {IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games},
  year = {2009},
  volume = {1},
  pages = {73--89},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {In order to promote computer Go and stimulate fur- ther development
	and research in the field, the event activities, Computational Intelligence
	Forum andWorld 9 9 Computer Go Championship, were held in Taiwan.
	This study focuses on the in- vited games played in the tournamentTaiwaneseGoPlayersVersus
	the Computer Program MoGo held at the National University of Tainan
	(NUTN), Tainan, Taiwan. Several Taiwanese Go players, including one
	9-Dan (9D) professional Go player and eight am- ateur Go players,
	were invited by NUTN to play against MoGo from August 26 to October
	4, 2008. The MoGo program combines all-moves-as-first (AMAF)/rapid
	action value estimation (RAVE) values, online â€œupper confidence
	tree (UCT)-likeâ€? values, offline values extracted from databases,
	and expert rules. Additionally, four properties of MoGo are analyzed
	including: 1) the weakness in corners, 2) the scaling over time,
	3) the behavior in handicap games, and 4) the main strength of MoGo
	in contact fights. The results reveal that MoGo can reach the level
	of 3 Dan (3D) with: 1) good skills for fights, 2) weaknesses in corners,
	in particular, for â€œsemeaiâ€? situations, and 3) weaknesses in
	favorable situations such as handicap games. It is hoped that the
	advances in AI and com- putational power will enable considerable
	progress in the field of computer Go, with the aim of achieving the
	same levels as com- puter Chess or Chinese Chess in the future.},
